/**
 * One build stamp for every asset the site loads at runtime.
 *
 * GitHub Pages serves everything with `Cache-Control: max-age=600`, so a URL that
 * never changes can come back up to ten minutes stale. That has silently broken
 * this site four separate times: a renamed game, a fixed credit line, a restyled
 * cover and a rewritten avatar all "didn't deploy".
 *
 * The rule: any asset referenced from JavaScript goes through `versioned()`. HTML
 * documents are covered the same way — play.js appends the stamp to the game's
 * iframe URL, which busts the document itself.
 *
 * Bump BUILD whenever you change a file the site loads. It is one string, in one
 * place, on purpose.
